# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Just Aaron


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aaron M Sabu - College of engineering, karunagappally.

### Project Description
Awkward Date is the world‚Äôs most entertaining real-time ‚Äúsocial skills analyzer.‚Äù It watches your face (and general awkwardness) during conversations, scoring your cringe levels, and responding with meme-y overlays, dramatic alerts, and completely useless advice. Instead of helping you with dating‚Äîit makes every moment more hilarious.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People accidentally radiate awkwardness on dates, at parties, and during presentations. But nobody tracks this in real-time, leaving cringe unmeasured and unappreciated.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A Python-powered AI ‚Äúassistant‚Äù that detects your anxious face, suspicious hand gestures, and moments of dead silence, then shoots meme warnings, sound effects, and over-the-top visuals onto your screen. Because nothing cures awkwardness like being called out by your laptop!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
Language: Python 3.10+

Frameworks: Streamlit (for rapid web UI), OpenCV (video feed & overlays)

Libraries:
